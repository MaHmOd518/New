          The history of technology is the history of the invention of tools and
          techniques and is one of the categories of the history of humanity.
          Technology can refer to methods ranging from as simple as stone tools
          to the complex genetic engineering and information technology that has
          emerged since the 1980s. The term technology comes from the Greek word
          techne, meaning art and craft, and the word logos, meaning word and
          speech. It was first used to describe applied arts, but it is now used
          to described advancements and changes which affect the environment
          around us.

          New knowledge has enabled people to create new things, and conversely,
          many scientific endeavors are made possible by technologies which
          assist humans in traveling to places they could not previously reach,
          and by scientific instruments by which we study nature in more detail
          than our natural senses allow.
        </p>

          Since much of technology is applied science, technical history is
          connected to the history of science. Since technology uses resources,
          technical history is tightly connected to economic history. From those
          resources, technology produces other resources, including
          technological artifacts used in everyday life.

          Technological change affects, and is affected by, a society's cultural
          traditions. It is a force for economic growth and a means to develop
          and project economic, political, military power and wealth.

          Many sociologists and anthropologists have created social theories
          dealing with social and cultural evolution. Some, like Lewis H.
          Morgan, Leslie White, and Gerhard Lenski have declared technological
          progress to be the primary factor driving the development of human
          civilization. Morgan's concept of three major stages of social
          evolution (savagery, barbarism, and civilization) can be divided by
          technological milestones, such as fire. White argued the measure by
          which to judge the evolution of culture was energy.

          For White, "the primary function of culture" is to "harness and
          control energy." White differentiates between five stages of human
          development: In the first, people use the energy of their own muscles.
          In the second, they use the energy of domesticated animals. In the
          third, they use the energy of plants (agricultural revolution). In the
          fourth, they learn to use the energy of natural resources: coal, oil,
          gas. In the fifth, they harness nuclear energy. White introduced a
          formula P=E*T, where E is a measure of energy consumed, and T is the
          measure of the efficiency of technical factors using the energy. In
          his own words, "culture evolves as the amount of energy harnessed per
          capita per year is increased, or as the efficiency of the instrumental
          means of putting the energy to work is increased". Nikolai Kardashev
          extrapolated his theory, creating the Kardashev scale, which
          categorizes the energy use of advanced civilizations.
